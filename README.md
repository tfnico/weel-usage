This is just an example project using weel as a library.

See http://rjeschke.github.com/weel/ for more info about weel.

In order to build this project, you need to check out weel from source, and build it into your maven repository first (mvn install).

If there is no pom.xml in your weel repo yet, you can find one in this fork:
